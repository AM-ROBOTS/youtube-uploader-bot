### Info

This is a simple hobby project which I was really curious about to implement. This is a Telegram bot which uses [Youtube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/ "Youtube Data API v3") to upload videos to Youtube.

### Libraries Used

- [Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram "Pyrogram")
- [Google Client API](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client "Google Client API")

### Setup

:heavy_exclamation_mark: This project requires Python3.6 or higher

**Clone and setup virtual environment**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/AM-ROBOTS/youtube-uploader-bot.git

$ cd utube

$ python3 -m venv venv

$ source venv/bin/activate

```

**Environment Variables**

- `BOT_TOKEN`(Required) - Get your bot token from [Bot Father](https://tx.me/BotFather "Bot Father").
- `SESSION_NAME`(optional) - Your bot's username.
- `API_ID`(Required) - Your telegram api id, get from [Manage Apps](https://my.telegram.org).

- `VIDEO_TITLE_SUFFIX`(optional) - Any suffix to be added to the video's title.
- `UPLOAD_MODE`(optional) - The video's privacy status. Valid values for this property are: `private`, `public`, `unlisted`.
- `DEBUG` (optional) - Whether to set logging level to DEBUG. If set logging will be set to DEBUG level, else INFO level.

**Getting your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`**

- Head to [Google console](https://console.developers.google.com "Google console"), create a new project named `Youtube Uploader` and enable `API'S AND SERVISES`. Search for `YOUTUBE DATA API v3` and enable the API. Go to [Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials "Credentials") page, select your project `Youtube Uploader` create a new credential with `desktop` as type. Copy the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
- You have to verify your application with google, only then you can make the uploaded videos public. YouTube changed its developer policy, and videos uploaded using unverfied applications will be kept private.

**Install requirements**

Run :

```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Run bot**

Lets run our bot for the first time!

```bash
$ python3 -m bot
```

If you did everything correctly, the bot should be running. Go do `/start` to see if the bot is live or not. Follow the instructions provided by bot to setup authorisation and to start uploading.

**Or the easy way of directly deploying to heroku**

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

### Development Status

This project is actively maintained and will continue so until I'm tired of it.

### Special notes

- With the Youtube Data API you are awarded with 10,000 points of requests. For one video upload it costs 1605 points, regardless of file size, which calculates to about 6 uploads daily. Once you have exhausted your daily points, you have to wait till daily reset. Resets happens at 0:00 PST, i.e. 12:30 IST. So make your uploads count.

- Uploading copyright contents will leads to immediate blocking of the video.

- By default, all the videos are uploaded as private with random category id unless you provide `UPLOAD_MODE` and `VIDEO_CATEGORY`. You may change it after youtube processes the video.


### Video Tutorial
